More details on the tasks in the thesis description:

• Task 0
   ◇ ~2 weeks
   ◇ Also hello world enclave in SGX dev environment, with i/o and r/w from disk

• Task 3
   ◇ depends on the results from 1 and 2

• Task 4
   ◇ Running the algorithm multiple times on the same input, can weaken the randomness/privacy guarantees of the privacy-preserving part. we need to avoid that. Kari and Esfandiari have ideas.

• Task 5
   ◇ we'll see how much time we have for this

• Task ...
   ◇ Where “real research” resp new things would happen
   ◇ This could very well be the hardest task if we get here

• Task n
   ◇ 1 month for writing

• Read about the ML algorithm
• Fully read the papers
• Hello world enclave as described above.
• prepare eth paperwork for thesis start

			<rich_text scale="h2">What I did the past week</rich_text>
			<rich_text>

• Reading “Intel SGX explained” paper (120 pages, from MIT)
   ◇ gone through background on computer architecture (CPU and memory)

• Read Theos thesis (except synthetic data generation)
   ◇ understand the idea of  Decision Trees and Gradient Boosting, Differential privacy
      ▪ how exactly the formulas are derived, not clear

• Working/backup private github repo
   ◇ because no permission for ethz gitlab
   ◇ add and share link with you in mettermost?
      ▪ would need github names
   ◇ Time log excel
   ◇ </rich_text>
			<rich_text foreground="#ffffc0c0cbcb">write in mattermost whenever I finished a task</rich_text>
			<rich_text>
      ▪ then you can add something if you want

• Read side channel papers
   ◇ finished 2/6 (oldest ones)

• can run enclaves in my OS
   ◇ not yet created my own enclave
   ◇ but checked out and ran the SampleEnclave that installation comes with

----------------------------- still TODO ----------------------------------

• read the GBDT paper
• run theos algorithm to understand it better
   ◇ compare code and thesis
   ◇ understand what's new compared to the GBDT paper
• need to read the rest of the side-channel papers
• play around with the hello world enclave

			<rich_text>

• Looking at the the python code.... when generating a cpp algorithm
   ◇ math, ML and other libraries?
      ▪ just use whatever cpp libraries I can find?
      ▪ or what's the strategy here
      ▪ other recommandations from you guys, maybe you've already done it?
